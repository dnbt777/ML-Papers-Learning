chess evaluation function


evaluate learning rate of transformers 
treatment: trained on pre-compressed data
control: trained on the exact same dataset
method
	1 make strings ("aabbaceydoas") with rules
		"i before e except after c"
		"three consonants may never touch"
	2 make simple compression scheme
		AWS type "a3b2aceydoas"
	3 train a control and experiment transformer, graph learning progress




compression transformer
make a transformer to compress the data, and uncompress it
then train another transformer on this data



idea
compress data via a tree
binary compression?
input = data
output = sequence through flowchart (train model to compress this as best as possible)
lossless and completely reversible



continuous transformer - like continuous markov chain
